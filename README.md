# playground
## Introduction
This is my little playground. It contains a variety of bits of code used
for various purposes.

## Installation
You are free to clone this repository and any of its code. If you do use my code 
in your projects, I certainly would appreciate a shout-out or some credit.

### Python
Under the Python directory, there is a **requirements.txt** file. This file can be used to
install required packages for the sample code to run. _You must first have Python
and pip installed_. The following code can be run to install the required modules
from the directory where the **requirements.txt** reside.

```commandline
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
